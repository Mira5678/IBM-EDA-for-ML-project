# IBM-EDA-for-ML-project
This project investigates on how smoking influences insurance charges and examines whether smokers incur higher charges compared to non-smokers. It explores relationships between smoking status, insurance charges and other factors such as BMI, age, sex, children etc.

Overview:
- Planned out data exploration
- Used exploratory data analysis to examine how smoking status impacts insurance charges
- Visualized trends and correlations and plot distributions using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Data cleaning using pandas
- Used one-hot encoding to prepare dataset for machine learning using scikit-learn
- Explore statistical relationships using Numpy
- Formed three hypotheses and validated them

Tools:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Collab)
